I was sent on a trip to Ancient Greece recently. I can’t disclose too many details publicly, but I arrived in the summertime, which is the perfect time of year to be watching for seabirds in Greece. It’s very difficult to collect any usable data for research during non-Watcher missions, but I was at least lucky enough to get some birdwatching in in the two days that I was there, and I was even able to speak to a few gulls—several _Chroicocephalus ridibundus_, to be precise!

I made a list of seabirds that I was able to identify.

| SPECIES                      | COUNT | NOTES                                                                                                                                                          |
| :--------------------------- | :---: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Chroicocephalus ridibundus_ |  27   | I saw a lot of them, and they _are_ supposed to be common this time of year, but the number is probably skewed by the fact that I was offering them food.      |
| _Ichthyaetus melanocephalus_ |  20   | They seem to be a good deal smaller than their modern counterparts? Might be imagining it. Didn’t have anything to measure with.                               |
| _Haematopus ostralegus_      |  18   | Lovely, noisy guys. I saw a bunch smashing open molluscs along the shores.                                                                                     |
| _Larus cachinnans_           |  15   | I saw one catch a whole ground squirrel. Good job!                                                                                                             |
| _Ichthyaetus audouinii_      |  13   | Even before everything on Earth happened, these guys were a vulnerable species for quite some time. It’s nice to see that that wasn’t always the case, though. |
| _Sterna hirundo_             |  12   | These guys really will just make their nests anywhere, huh…                                                                                                    |
| _Gelochelidon nilotica_      |  12   | Lovely specimens with their summer black caps and bills!                                                                                                       |
| _Sternula albifrons_         |  11   | Their common name is “the little tern.” Suits them.                                                                                                            |
| _Hydroprogne caspia_         |   8   | Huge guys! Spotted a few pairs mixed in with other species’ colonies.                                                                                          |
| _Thalasseus sandvicensis_    |   7   | Saw a few hunting!                                                                                                                                             |
| _Chroicocephalus genei_      |   4   | These are relatively uncommon birds!!! Not sure if I was lucky, or if they were more common in antiquity. Faintly pink breast! It’s summertime alright!        |
| _Ichthyaetus ichthyaetus_    |   1   | It’s not winter yet. What are you doing here??? Huge guy. Wasn’t expecting to see one all the way out here.                                                    |
| _Gelochelidon nilotica_ (?)  |   5   | But I’m listing these ones separately down here because I wasn’t quite confident that I properly distinguished them from juvenile _Thalasseus sandvicensis_…   |
| _Thalasseus bengalensis_ (?) |   3   | Saw a few diving for fish while out on the sea, though I was a little busy at the time with other tasks to look too closely.                                   |

I wish I’d had more time to examine the birds—many gulls reach maturity in about 4 years, so 3 millennia is nearly enough time for 750 generations! I wonder how much has changed since?
