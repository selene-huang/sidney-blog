The chimpanzee, scientific name _Pan troglodytes_, is a great ape of the genus _Pan_. After the bonobo went extinct in the 23rd century, the chimp remains the only genus species left in our sister taxon _Pan_, leaving them our closest living relative. In spite of this they are, very evidently, _not_ human; and yet, some recent events have left me curious about the effects of human-like socialization on chimpanzees, so I have decided to turn to archival records for answers.

The earliest records of chimpanzees trained on human behavior date back to 1926, from the London Zoo’s Chimpanzee Tea Parties. A form of public entertainment intended to increase the zoo’s popularity, the tea parties involved dressing the chimpanzees in human clothes and giving them a table of snacks to eat and cups to sip from. The great success of these exhibits subsequently inspired PG Tips, a tea company, to similarly train chimpanzee actors to star in their TV advertisements.

These shows and adverts were not recognized as harmful to the chimpanzees involved until much later in their lives. The PG Tips chimpanzees continued to favor human companionship over the company of their own species, even in old age, and often failed to understand non-verbal communication from other non-trained chimpanzees [[1]](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leicestershire-23508215). Both practices ended in the 2000s, as rising concerns over animal rights and ethics forced the zoo to stop.

Despite this, chimpanzees actually remained a popular exotic pet until the early 23rd century, when a new clade of monkeypox forced governments to crack down on chimpanzee pet bans. Records of such pets reveal that chimpanzees could be taught to open doors with keys, dress themselves, eat at tables, and even operate computers and cars. But despite their high intelligence, chimpanzees remain undomesticated, and keeping them as pets often resulted in both human and chimpanzee fatalities. Even among those who were simply surrendered, human-socialized chimpanzees did not typically retain enough chimpanzee behavior to be returned to zoos or the wild [[2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20150202195221/http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp-central-pets).

Today, chimpanzees are still an incredibly dangerous choice of housepet, but drug and behavioral research performed by Hammond and Byrd during the monkeypox epidemic has made chimpanzee training and socialization much safer in a lab setting. Because of the centuries-long memorandum on non-human ape research, the extent to which chimpanzees can be trained to fit into human society is still largely unknown.

In recent decades, chimpanzees’ language capabilities in particular have been of interest, but whether or not they are actually capable of learning any form of language in the way that humans are able to is still highly contested. For anyone who keeps up with the _Interplanetary Journal of Biological Sciences_, this is probably already self-evident from the long series of back-and-forth papers published by Solis and Chamberpuff. I expect Chamberpuff will be publishing a rebuttal to Solis’s 2342 paper on chimpanzees & MSL soon, actually—so keep your eyes peeled in the next _Interplanetary Journal of Biological Sciences_ issue!

That concludes today’s archive trawl. I learned a lot about chimpanzees’ historical relationship with humans today, but I’m also terribly behind on some computations for my actual research now… I should get started on the data input sometime before midnight tonight.
