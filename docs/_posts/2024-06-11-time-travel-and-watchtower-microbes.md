Today after the lab meeting, Marissa approached me about her recent Watchtower soil samples project. For those of you who haven’t read my latest Tuesday lab meeting post, or who don’t have too much time technology background, here’s some context:

- Recent soil samples within the Watchtower have found what we suspect are past & future strains of bacteria in the sewage system
- Due to the nature of modern time technology, which requires a watch for each living organism that travels through time, time travel only has two potential risks for non-native species introduction:
  1. Via animals, plants, or microbes stored in a pocketwatch’s special pocket dimension
  2. Via an individual traveler’s unique gut microbiome
- But pocketwatches have special, built-in decontamination mechanisms so it’s probably not #1

Marissa said that she’d been in touch with some Chrono-Co time tech people since last meeting and had confirmed that the pocketwatch decontamination was working as expected, which leaves individual agents as the most likely culprit (which, to be honest, was the more likely answer anyway, given the distribution of the microbes), so she’d like to do some investigating into that.

The problem is: Marissa’s not a field agent, and she doesn’t have a watch. So she’s looking for a team of about two or three Watcher investigators to help her collect soil samples from timelines during missions, while she tests agents before and after missions for any differences in their gut flora. Right now she thinks missions are too short to have much of an impact on agents environmentally, so the working hypothesis is that agents who consume food and drink on a mission may be exposing themselves to anachronistic microbes and then bringing them back to the Watchtower.

She already has an outline typed up, which she showed to me, and it looks pretty solid. If she can get a few more investigators to sign on, she’s planning to present it for funding and approval next lab meeting. She seems optimistic about everything, though I’m not sure that will last.

No matter what the results are, Marissa’s in for a rough ride. If it _is_ indeed agents’ gut microbiomes causing the problem, then there’s no easy solution. We can’t really ban food and drink on missions; that’s just asking for trouble, and it likely wouldn’t stop most agents anyway. We _could_ just nuke everything, the way we do in pocketwatch decontamination procedures, but while that isn’t necessarily fatal it’s also not great for the host for a number of reasons. Plus, a lot of bacteria species in the gut, once wiped out, cannot be reliably re-established. And if it’s _not_ agents’ gut flora, then Marissa doesn’t actually have another working hypothesis right now, so: bad news, no matter what.

But that part of it isn’t my problem, so I’ll probably sign on and back the research proposal next meeting. Looks like I’ll be very busy soon!

(I wonder if it’s possible for plant seeds to be transported back alive via the digestive track, then? That would eliminate the need for a pocketwatch in order to collect samples, which would really help diversify the Watcher’s seed bank! Reminder to self to look into that, if Marissa’s hypothesis pans out.)
