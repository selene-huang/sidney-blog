So guess whose hard drive failed catastrophically…

Although I back up my research files pretty regularly, I don’t usually bother with my other files, and I definitely wasn’t expecting my old website server to crash too. I’ve made a couple restoration attempts but am not particularly well-versed in this kind of tech work, so my old blog posts might just be gone… Guess that’s one lesson learned the hard way.

I’ll be back to my usual posting soon, but I need to finish prepping these demos for the next grant meeting, so it’s not a priority as of right now. I’ll see you when I see you! I’m just making this post for now so people will stop emailing me asking what happened to everything else.

(Speaking of emails—I’m fairly certain some of my regular visitors have mentioned that they archive sites? Please shoot me an email if you have any snapshots of my old entries, I’d be glad to restore even one or two of them.)
