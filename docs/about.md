Watcher Headquarters, Room 706

I am Sidney Stockton, an investigator working for Counselor Tuhorn of Rats and a member of the Watchers in Wait. I am a part of the chrono-biological research division for the Watchers as well as the Watchtower’s Ecological Integrity Maintenance Corps (EIMC).
My research interests include all species endemic, endangered, and extinct. This requires both extensive archive knowledge and time travel-adjacent field work, so I’m not often in my office, and you will usually have better luck contacting me via email. You are also welcome to drop by the chrono-biological division’s Tuesday lab meetings, which are open to public attendance on the first Tuesday of every month. I would especially love to meet with you if you are also working in field biology, or have special archive access.

Current focuses:

- Investigating the endangered plant genus *Rutilan*
- Cataloging historical & time-travel based evidence for extinct species *Subdolus* n. sp. C
- Collecting soil samples for co-authored paper on modern-day microbials’ potential to affect timelines
- Prototyping & testing of new sampling technologies

I was previously a graduate student in McLaughlin University’s chrono-biological research group, where I studied time travel’s effects on developing organisms under the guidance of Professor Alexis Nettleship. The journals we published to at the time were not paywalled, but I have recently received several complaints that they are now charging subscription access, so! If you’d like a copy of those papers, just email me.
