        <h2>ABOUT</h2>

        <p>sstockton@thewatch.xxx</p>

<p>Watcher Headquarters, Room 706</p>

<p>I am Sidney Stockton, an investigator working for Counselor Tuhorn of Rats and a member of the Watchers in Wait. I am a part of the chrono-biological research division for the Watchers as well as the Watchtower‚Äôs Ecological Integrity Maintenance Corps (EIMC).</p>

<p>My research interests include all species endemic, endangered, and extinct. This requires both extensive archive knowledge and time travel-adjacent field work, so I‚Äôm not often in my office, and you will usually have better luck contacting me via email. You are also welcome to drop by the chrono-biological division‚Äôs Tuesday lab meetings, which are open to public attendance on the first Tuesday of every month. I would especially love to meet with you if you are also working in field biology or have special archive access.</p>

<p>Current focuses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Investigating the endangered plant genus <em>Rutilan</em></li>
  <li>Cataloging historical &amp; time-travel based evidence for extinct species <em>Subdolus</em> n. sp. C</li>
  <li>Collecting soil samples for co-authored paper on modern-day microbials‚Äô potential to affect timelines</li>
  <li>Prototyping &amp; testing of new sampling technologies</li>
</ul>

<p>I was previously a graduate student in McLaughlin University‚Äôs chrono-biological research group, where I studied time travel‚Äôs effects on developing organisms under the guidance of Professor Alexis Nettleship. The journals we published to at the time were not paywalled, but I have recently received several complaints that they are now charging subscription access, so! If you‚Äôd like a copy of those papers, just email me.</p>

All research and notes found here are my personal opinions and are not representative of any organizational stance on any of these topics.
