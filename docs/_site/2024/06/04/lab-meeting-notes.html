        <h2>JUNE 2346 LAB MEETING NOTES</h2>

        </div>

        <p>It‚Äôs the first Tuesday of the month, so you know what that means: the biology division‚Äôs public lab meeting! On the agenda this week we had a presentation from Stuart Stillwell on timeline extinction counts as a measure of evolutionary fitness of a species; Marissa Waywater on microbial activity in various lunar soil samples; Wisconsin Cheese on Chrono-Co‚Äôs second quarter mining impact report; and, last but not least, a presentation from yours truly about field usage of my human-animal communication device.</p>

<p>We kicked off the meeting with some opening remarks from Tuhorn, which you probably know by now that he doesn‚Äôt normally bother with, but we had a lot more Chrono-Co employees in attendance than usual because of the quarterly report analysis so the meetings are run a bit more formally.</p>

<p>Next up was Stuart‚Äôs presentation. The key points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This paper was inspired by a recent paper on 500 B.C. extinction events (mine), whose narrow focus on a specific time period renders the results ungeneralizable (I will render <em>him</em> ungeneralizable)</li>
  <li>He compiled all field reports from the watcher‚Äôs archives and created a database of all recorded extinction events in alternate timelines, then added in known extinction events from the past century in our current timeline</li>
  <li>He finds that 96.3% of species who are extinct in this timeline have also gone extinct in alternate timelines, and 87% of them within ten years of each other</li>
  <li>He proposes, with some refinements, using survivability within timelines as an overall indicator of evolutionary fitness of a species</li>
</ul>

<p>Thoughts: I think Stuart is a fool who needs to revisit elementary temporal statistics. At a glance, his equations don‚Äôt seem to fully account for the fact that timeline probabilities are not independent of each other, making his results far more statistically significant than they should be. I <em>will</em> be writing a rebuttal whenever I have the chance to look through his new paper, even if ‚Äútapestry of time‚Äù-school research is stupid.</p>

<p>Next, Marissa‚Äôs presentation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>She collected samples from 10 different lunar sites, as well as 20 locations within the Watchtower itself in order to analyze microbial activity</li>
  <li>Two lunar sites‚Äîthe ones closest to the Chrono-Co mines‚Äîseem to have developed new strain of Knallgas bacteria, which is being further investigated in the lab right now
    <ul>
      <li>However, she notes that it‚Äôs unlikely the moon will ever be able to support more than a few strains of extremophile bacteria</li>
      <li>Even if the bacteria manage to establish a livable atmosphere again for other organisms, it will likely be stripped away again by solar winds</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Odd strains of bacteria are being found primarily in the Watchtower‚Äôs sewage systems
    <ul>
      <li>Based on preliminary analysis, they‚Äôre suspected to be past or future strains of bacteria, brought into Watchtower time by various agents via their gut microbiome, but it could also be a failure in the pocket watch decontamination mechanism</li>
      <li>Stressed the need for more research</li>
      <li>If it turns out to be the microbiome case, she also recommends further research into potential ecological effects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thoughts: I really hope it‚Äôs not the pocket dimension decontamination procedures that are failing, but on the flipside if they‚Äôre being brought in via time traveler microbiomes, it‚Äôs unlikely we‚Äôll be able to eliminate or prevent the introduction of out-of-time strains. So that might actually be worse? But pretty concerning news all around.</p>

<p>Next was Cheese‚Äôs analysis of the Chrono-Co mining reports, but I was up late last night and maaaaay have dozed off part way. Fer‚Äôll be publishing an editorial version of it soon though, to be put up on Chrono-Co‚Äôs website alongside the mining report, so you can go find it there if you‚Äôre curious. I don‚Äôt think fer mentioned anything out of the ordinary, though.</p>

<p>Finally, my own presentation! I had to spend more time in the lab than anticipated analyzing other data, so I wasn‚Äôt able to collect any rigorous field data like I had hoped, but here are some preliminary findings with my new human-animal communication device prototype:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seems to have an effective range of approximately 9m</li>
  <li>Appears effective on terrestrial chordates; have not yet had an opportunity to try with fully aquatic chordates; and have had limited success connecting with other phylums in the Animalia kingdom
    <ul>
      <li>Have successfully managed to gather case-relevant information from several mammalian and avian species</li>
      <li>The differences in intelligibility between species does not seem to be fully explained by genetic similarities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once successful communication has been established, animals do not seem to be particularly inclined or disinclined to help; like with humans, individual personalities play a big role
    <ul>
      <li>That said, most are pretty easily bribed with food</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A brief survey of animals who frequent the parks in the Watchtower suggests that the general populace remains unaware of appropriate wildlife diet‚Äîthis would probably be a good topic to run the next EIMC educational campaign on</li>
</ul>

<p>After presentations we ran the usual Q&amp;A and proposals section and wrapped up promptly at 10:30am. I‚Äôll see you next month for the July lab meeting!</p>
