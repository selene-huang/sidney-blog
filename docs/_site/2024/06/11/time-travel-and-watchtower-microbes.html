        <p>Today after the lab meeting, Marissa approached me about her recent Watchtower soil samples project. For those of you who haven‚Äôt read my latest Tuesday lab meeting post, or who don‚Äôt have too much time technology background, here‚Äôs some context:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recent soil samples within the Watchtower have found what we suspect are past &amp; future strains of bacteria in the sewage system</li>
  <li>Due to the nature of modern time technology, which requires a watch for each living organism that travels through time, time travel only has two potential risks for non-native species introduction:
    <ol>
      <li>Via animals, plants, or microbes stored in a pocketwatch‚Äôs special pocket dimension</li>
      <li>Via an individual traveler‚Äôs unique gut microbiome</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>But pocketwatches have special, built-in decontamination mechanisms so it‚Äôs probably not #1</li>
</ul>

<p>Marissa said that she‚Äôd been in touch with some Chrono-Co time tech people since last meeting and had confirmed that the pocketwatch decontamination was working as expected, which leaves individual agents as the most likely culprit (which, to be honest, was the more likely answer anyway, given the distribution of the microbes), so she‚Äôd like to do some investigating into that.</p>

<p>The problem is: Marissa‚Äôs not a field agent, and she doesn‚Äôt have a watch. So she‚Äôs looking for a team of about two or three Watcher investigators to help her collect soil samples from timelines during missions, while she tests agents before and after missions for any differences in their gut flora. Right now she thinks missions are too short to have much of an impact on agents environmentally, so the working hypothesis is that agents who consume food and drink on a mission may be exposing themselves to out-of-time microbes and then bringing them back to the Watchtower.</p>

<p>She already has an outline typed up, which she showed to me, and it looks pretty solid. If she can get a few more investigators to sign on, she‚Äôs planning to present it for funding and approval next lab meeting. She seems optimistic about everything, though I‚Äôm not sure that will last.</p>

<p>No matter what the results are, Marissa‚Äôs in for a rough ride. If it <em>is</em> indeed agents‚Äô gut microbiomes causing the problem, then there‚Äôs no easy solution. We can‚Äôt really ban food and drink on missions; that‚Äôs just asking for trouble, and it likely wouldn‚Äôt stop most agents anyway. We <em>could</em> just nuke everything, the way we do in pocketwatch decontamination procedures, but while that isn‚Äôt necessarily fatal it‚Äôs also not great for the host for a number of reasons. Plus, a lot of bacteria species in the gut, once wiped out, cannot be reliably re-established. And if it‚Äôs <em>not</em> agents‚Äô gut flora, then Marissa doesn‚Äôt actually have another working hypothesis right now, so: bad news, no matter what.</p>

<p>But that part of it isn‚Äôt my problem, so I‚Äôll probably sign on and back the research proposal next meeting. Looks like I‚Äôll be very busy soon!</p>

<p>(I wonder if it‚Äôs possible for plant seeds to be transported back alive via the digestive track, then? That would eliminate the need for a pocketwatch in order to collect samples, which would really help diversify the Watcher‚Äôs seed bank! Reminder to self to look into that, if Marissa‚Äôs hypothesis pans out.)</p>
